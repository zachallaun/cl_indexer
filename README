This is an application to scrape craiglist housing data and make it accessible in a sqlite database.  It only scrapes Brooklyn at the moment because I don't want to get blocked from the Craigslist servers.

It's not perfect data because this is Craigslist - people lie about neighborhoods or omit information entirely.  Hopefully legitmate ads will drown out the noise with enough volume.
